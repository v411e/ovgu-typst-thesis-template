## Using this repository
Github does not allow private forks of public repositories.
However you can use this [trick](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66948475) to create a private repo
that has the same commit history and allows you to pull in updates and improvements of this template into your private repository easily.

1. Use the [Github Importer](https://github.com/new/import) with this repository (`https://github.com/v411e/ovgu-typst-thesis-template.git`) to create a new private one.
1. Add this template as remote `git remote add template git@github.com:v411e/ovgu-typst-thesis-template.git`
1. Now you can directly pull updates and improvements of this template into your own repo
   `git fetch template`
   `git merge template/main`
